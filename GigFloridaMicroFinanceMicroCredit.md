# μCredit™|MicroCredit™: The definition of μFinance™|MicroFinance™
---
### Money growth 
---
“μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™, is banking the unbankable, bringing credit, savings, and all other financial services within the reach of millions of people who are too financially disadvantaged to be served by regular banks, in most cases because they are unable to offer sufficient collateral. In general, banks are for people with money, not for people without.” (Gert van Maanen, Microcredit: Sound Business or Development Instrument, Oikocredit, 2004)

“μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is based on the premise that the financially disadvantaged have skills that remain unutilized or underutilized. It is not the lack of skills that makes financially disadvantaged people financially disadvantaged….charity is not the answer to poverty. It only helps poverty to continue. It creates dependency and takes away the individual’s initiative to break through the wall of poverty. Unleashing of energy and creativity in each human being is the answer to poverty.” (Muhammad Yunus, Expanding MicroCredit Outreach to Reach the Millennium Development Goals, International Seminar on Attacking Poverty with MicroCredit, Dhaka, Bangladesh, January 2003)

μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ belongs to the group of financial service innovations under the term of μCredit™|MicroCredit™, other services according to μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ are μSave™|MicroSave™ | μSaving™|MicroSaving™, Other Money Transfer Vehicles, and μInsurance™|MicroInsurance™. Also, μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ are an innovation for developing countries. 

μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is a service for:
- Financially Financially Disadvantaged Individuals, that are unemployed
- Entrepreneurs, or (e.g. Farmers who are Not Bankable or NonBankable

The reason why they are not bankable is:
- the lack of collateral
- steady employment
- income
- verifiable credit history
because of these reasons they can't even meet the minimal qualifications for ordinary credit. 

By helping everyone with μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ it gives them more available choices and opportunities with reduced risk. It has successfully enabled financially disadvantaged people to start their own business generating or sustaining an income and often begin to build up wealth and exit poverty. The amount of money that is loaned out seldom exceeds USD $100.00-$1000.00 ($25-$50-$75-$100-$125-$150-$175-$200-$500-$750-$1000 and upwards)

μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ fits best to those with entrepreneurial capability and possibility. This translates to those financially disadvantaged who work in growing economies, and who can undertake activities that generate weekly stable incomes. For those who don't qualify because they are extremely financially disadvantaged like destitute and homeless almost every μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institution has special safety programs that offer basic subsistence and later endeavors to graduate these members in their μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ program making ordinary μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ available.

- μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ plays an important role in fighting the multi-dimensional aspects of poverty.
- μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ increases household income, which leads to attendant benefits such as increased food security, the building of assets, and an increased likelihood of educating oneself and/or children. 
- μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is also a means for self-empowerment. 
- It enables the financially disadvantaged to make changes when they increase income, become business owners and reduce their vulnerability to external shocks like illness, weather, and all other things that might incurr extra unforseen expenses.

μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ has widely been directed by the non-profit sector while commercial lenders require more conventional forms of collateral before making loans to μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions. But now it´s successfully growing bigger and getting more credibility in the traditional finance world. Due to that, the traditional banking industry has begun to realize that these borrowers fit more correctly in a category called pre-bankable. The industry has realized that those who lack access to traditional formal financial institutions require and desire a variety of financial products. Nowadays the mainstream finance industry is counting the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ projects as a source of growth. Before almost everyone were neglecting the success of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ at the beginning of the 1970s when pilot projects such as ACCION were released until the United Nations declared 2005 the International Year of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™.

Most of the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions and agencies all over the world focuses on women in developing countries. Observations and experience show that women are a small credit risk, repaying their loans and tend more often to benefit the whole family. In another aspect, it´s also seen as a method giving the women more status in a socioeconomic way and changing the current conservative relationship between gender and class when women can provide income to the household. Women are in most cases responsible for children, and in financially disadvantaged conditions, it results in physical and social underdevelopment of their children. 1.2 billion people are living on less than a dollar a day. There are many reasons why women have become the primary target of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ services. A recent World Bank report confirms that societies that discriminate based on gender pay the cost of greater poverty, slower economic growth, weaker governance, and a lower living standard for all people. At a macro level, it is because 70 percent of the worlds most financially disadvantaged are women. Women have a higher unemployment rate than men in virtually every country and make up the majority of the informal sector of most economies. They constitute the bulk of those who need μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ services.

Giving women access to μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ loans, therefore, generates a multiplier effect that increases the impact of a μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institution’s activities, benefiting multiple generations.

### History of: μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™
---
The history of μCrediting™|MicroCrediting™ and μFinancing™|MicroFinancing™ can be traced back as long as the middle of the 1800s when the theorist Lysander Spooner was writing over the benefits from small credits to entrepreneurs and farmers as a way of getting people out of poverty. But it was at the end of World War II with the Marshall plan the concept had a big impact.

The today use of the expression μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ has its roots in the 1970s when organizations, such as Grameen Bank of Bangladesh with the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ pioneer Mohammad Yunus, were starting and shaping the modern industry of μCrediting™|MicroCrediting™ and μFinancing™|MicroFinancing™. Another pioneer in this sector is Akhtar Hameed Khan. At that time a new wave of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ initiatives introduced many innovations into the sector. Many pioneering enterprises began experimenting with loaning to underserved people. The main reason why μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is dated to the 1970s is that the programs could show that people can be relied on to repay their loans and that it´s possible to provide financial services to financially disadvantaged people through market-based enterprises without subsidies. Shorebank was the first μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ and community development bank founded in 1974 in Chicago.

An economical historian at Yale named Timothy Guinnane has been doing some research on Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen´s village bank movement in Germany which started in 1864 and by the year 1901, the bank had reached 2million rural farmers. Timothy Guinnane means that already then it was proved that μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ could pass the two tests concerning the common people’s payback-moral and the possibility to provide financial service to financially disadvantaged people.

Another organization, The Caisse Populaire movement grounded by Alphone and Dorimène Desjardins in Quebec, was also concerned about poverty and passed those two tests. Between 1900 to 1906 when they founded the first Caisse, they passed a law governing them in the Quebec assembly, they risked their private assets and must have been very sure about the idea about μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™.

Today the World Bank estimates that more than 16 million people are served by some 7000 μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions all over the world. CGAP experts mean that about 500 million families benefit from these small loans making new business possible. In a gathering at a μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Summit in Washington DC, the goal was reaching 100 million of the world´s most financially disadvantaged people by credits from the world leaders and major financial institutions.

The year 2005 was proclaimed as the International Year of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ by The Economic and Social Council of the United Nations in a call for the financial and building sector to “fuel” the strong entrepreneurial spirit of the financially disadvantaged people around the world.

The International Year of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ consists of five goals:
- Assess and promote the contribution of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ to the MFIs
- Making μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ more visible for public awareness and understanding is a very important part of the development situation
- The promotion should be inclusive of the financial sector
- Make a supporting system for sustainable access to financial services
- Support strategic partnerships by encouraging new partnerships and innovation to build and expand the outreach and success of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ for all

The economics professor Mohammad Yunus and the founder of Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel Prize 2006 for his efforts. The press release from nobelprize.org states:

“The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2006, divided into two equal parts, to Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank for their efforts to create economic and social development from below. Lasting peace can not be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty. μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is one such means. Development from below also serves to advance democracy and human rights. Muhammad Yunus has shown himself to be a leader who has managed to translate visions into practical action for the benefit of millions of people, not only in Bangladesh but also in many other countries. Loans to financially disadvantaged people without any financial security had appeared to be an impossible idea. From modest beginnings three decades ago, Yunus has, first and foremost through Grameen Bank, developed μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ into an ever more important instrument in the struggle against poverty. Grameen Bank has been a source of ideas and models for the many institutions in the field of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ that have sprung up around the world.

Every single individual on earth has both the potential and the right to live a decent life. Across cultures and civilizations, Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that even the most financially disadvantaged of all the financially disadvantaged can work to bring about their development.

μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ has proved to be an important liberating force in societies where women, in particular, have to struggle against repressive social and economic conditions. Economic growth and political democracy can not achieve their full potential unless the female half of humanity participates on an equal footing with the male.

Yunus’s long-term vision is to eliminate poverty in the world. That vision can not be realized through μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ alone. But Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that, in the continuing efforts to achieve it, μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ must play a major part.”

### The Fundamentals of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™
---
The managers at the MFIs are careful to ensure the borrower's success and inform about the risks involved, which makes, in general, the borrower performs better. This leads often to earned dignity and lasting self-confidence associated with responsible loan repayment.

To have a sustainable growing economy it takes high entrepreneurship and energy to develop the world and fight poverty. Independent and responsible entrepreneurs are valuable resources that can take advantage of the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ industry. They will not take big risks and must be supported by predictable financing.

Normal bank operations suit better to large transactions which are more profitable, the traditional operating philosophy is to invest in facilities and they have costly operating structures. The traditional financing industry must either change itself or stay out of the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ business. A new generation of banking institutions is growing in a market of very small transactions and less affluent clients. With lowered transactions costs through institutional specialization and innovation in delivery systems, they will be able to operate profitably in this market serving the financially disadvantaged with financial services.

The financially disadvantaged entrepreneurs are the future representing the population who will become successful in the nearby future. They have the same will and skills as the toughest business operators. They are economical, don’t take big risks, and repay debts as scheduled to maintain the possibility of borrowing money in the future.

This requires a new groundbreaking banking system with scale economics. Modifying the standard system will simply not be enough, the financially disadvantaged people will continue to stay outside their country´s economy. Building up μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions serving financially disadvantaged people is a relatively cost-effective use of subsidies for economic development compared to other supporting strategies for welfare.

### Economies of scale
---
MFIs need both capital and internal operating capacity to achieve scale. Since 1970 μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ has been proven to be one of the most effective and sustainable tools in poverty-fighting. But still are 80 percent of the working financially disadvantaged, more than 400 million families, are without the reach of financial services. To be able to serve everyone the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ industry must be even more efficient and grow to scale. At today's growth rates it will take decades for the rest 80 percent to be served.

### Access to μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Regional Breakdown
---
The most critical problem today is finding money to lend out to the financially disadvantaged. Existing μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ programs are coming to a virtual halt in their expansion program and finding it difficult to continue their present program because of a lack of funds.

### μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ failing to close the gap

Many μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions are self-sustaining but most of the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions still rely on and must get rid of their dependency on donor money to reach scale. Large amounts of money are needed to expand their operational capacity to reach economies of scale rapidly. 

Without sufficient internal operating capacity growth suddenly stops once a program reaches several thousand clients. They must provide their financial products to a much bigger amount of clients. The only possibility to access large amounts of money is in the traditional financial market. The problem for most MFIs to attract this money is the lack of track record and well-formed business plans.

The key solution to the right internal operating capacity includes improving for example the information technology, internal controls, new product development, and human resources. When MFIs rely too much on donor money it´s very hard to do the necessary investments in the areas that are sustainable and with the possibility to expand. That´s why most MFIs are small and stay small which this figure visualizes. About 73% of all μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions serve less than 2500 clients.

## Most MFIs are very small

#### μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Institutions (MFIs)
---
Poverty is the main cause of concern in improving the economic status of developing countries. A μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institution is an organization that offers financial services to low-income populations. Almost all give loans to their members, and many offer insurance, deposit, and other services.

A great scale of organizations is regarded as μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutes. They are those that offer credits and other financial services to the representatives of financially disadvantaged strata of the population (except for extremely financially disadvantaged strata).

- μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is increasingly being considered as one of the most effective tools of reducing poverty by enabling 
- μCredit™|MicroCredit™ to the Financially Disadvantaged.
- μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ has a significant role in bridging the gap between formal financial institutions and the rural financially disadvantaged.
- μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Institutions (MFIs) accesses financial resources from the Banks and other mainstream Financial Institutions and provide financially and support services to the financially disadvantaged.

MFIs are the pivotal overseas organizations in each country that make individual μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ loans directly to: 
- villagers
- microentrepreneurs
- impoverished women
- financially disadvantaged families

An overseas MFI is like a small bank with the same challenges and capital needs confronting any expanding small venture but with the added responsibility of serving economically marginalized populations. Many MFIs are creditworthy and well-run with proven records of success, many are operationally self-sufficient.

Various types of institutions offer μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™: 
- credit unions
- commercial banks
- Non-governmental Organizations (NGO)
- cooperatives
- sectors of government banks

The emergence of “for-profit” MFIs is growing. In the United Staes of America (USA), in Miami, Florida, BitCoin/MiamiCoin Technology Centers
In India, these ‘for-profit’ MFIs are referred to as Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC). 
(NGO)'s mainly work in remote rural areas thereby providing financial services to people with no access to banking services.

The terms “Transformation,” or "Commercialization" of a μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institution (MFI), using the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ format for deserving clients, refers to a change in legal status from an "Unregulated Nonprofit (501(c)3)" or "Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)" into a regulated, for-profit institution. Regulated, Transformed Organizations differ from nonprofits in that they are held to performance and capital adequacy standards and are supervised by a financial authority, typically the Central Bank of the country where they are registered. 

A transformed MFI also attracts equity investors. The equity investors want to ensure that the values of their investments are maintained or enhanced and elect Board members who share a common vision for the new for-profit institution. Among transformed MFIs, varying classifications of regulated institutions exist, the strictest being:
- banks
- rural banks and thrift banks
- followed by non-bank financial institution and/or Company (NBFC). 
Internationally, different countries have varied names for these regulated MFIs.

The μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ sector consistently focuses on understanding the needs of the financially disadvantaged and on devising better ways of delivering services in line with their requirements, developing the most efficient and effective mechanisms to deliver finance to the financially disadvantaged. Continuous efforts towards automation of operations are steadily improving inefficiency. The automated systems have also helped accelerate the growth rate of the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ sector.

### The goal for MFIs should be:
---
To improve the quality of life of the financially disadvantaged by providing access to financial and support services;

To be a viable financial institution developing sustainable communities;
- To mobilize resources to provide both, Financial and/or Support Services to the financially disadvantaged client, particularly women, for viable productive income generation enterprises enabling them to reduce their poverty;
- Learn and evaluate what helps people to move out of poverty faster;
- To create opportunities for self-employment for the underprivileged;
- To train rural financially disadvantaged in simple skills and enable them to utilize the available resources and contribute to employment and income generation in rural areas.

Many institutions practice μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™, or raise funds for μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™, including the following:
- Accion International
- ACDI/VOCA
- BRAC
- Enterprise Development International
- Five Talents International
- Freedom from Hunger
- Grameen Foundation
- Kiva
- Micro(μ)Loan Foundation
- Micro(μ)Credit Summit Campaign
- Micro(μ)Enterprise Access to Banking Services
- Opportunity International Australia
- ShoreBank
- Unitus
- World Council of Credit Unions
- SKS

### Funding / Financial Institutions:
---
The mission of the funding institutions is to help MFIs operate more efficiently and be more effective. They provide each partner with financial products and services that are tailored to meet their needs.

A goal is to ensure the partners are moving their clients out of poverty and to foster good practices for measuring the progress of the individuals' movement across poverty lines. MFIs must show results, yet many do not have the tools to evaluate how well they are fulfilling their mission of reducing poverty, reaching people excluded from financial services, empowering women, or promoting community solidarity. That´s why they should also equip Micro(μ)Finance institutions with tools to measure their clients’ progress out of poverty. Built on the learnings of previous efforts in the Micro(μ)Finance industry they can develop the operational methods in reaching the clients. Innovative financing solutions and strategies to expand the capacity and efficiency of the MFIs provide a direct impact on the lives of the financially disadvantaged and advance the Micro(μ)Finance industry as it moves toward even higher standards in terms of anti-poverty impact and financial performance.

## μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Products: we will do the math to find competitive percentages and/or pricing.
---
Offering financial services to the homeless, vagrant, the financially disadvantaged, and down-trotted, the financially uneducated and fiscally unwise, people in financial development, for the successes of their households, businesses, neighborhoods... This is an expensive business...

The cost is one of the biggest reasons why traditional banks do not make small loans, the resources, costs, and/or time required for just a 50$ loan are the same resources, costs, and/or time as for a 1000$ loan.

GigFlorida μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™, also has the personnel and administration costs. Field staff managers must perform household and business surveys before entering a household or business, conduct interviews with potential borrowers, in a lot of individual cases, we have to educate the borrowers in credit discipline, travel to the households and businesses every week to collect interest, and distribute loans and control that the loans are being used for the given purpose.

The μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ loan cycles are usually shorter than traditional commercial loans with terms from typically six months to a year with payments plus interest, paid weekly. Shorter loan cycles and weekly payments help the borrowers stay current and not become surprised by large payments. The transaction-intense nature of weekly payment collections, often in rural areas, is more expensive than running a bank branch that provides large loans to economically secure borrowers in a metropolitan area. As a result, GigFlorida μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ must charge interest rates that might sound high.

To be able to lend out money, the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions must in addition borrow from the traditional finance sector with a commercial perspective. There´s always about 1-2% loss on loans due to people not paying back. To be able to expand business the GigFlorida μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ must also make some profit, at least 1-2%. All in all, it´s easier to understand why GigFlorida μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ charges their customer interest rates which at first sight might appear high. With a growing market, better economics of scale and increasing efficiency the cost will reduce, and lower interest rates are able.

For a financial institution to scale and remain sustainable, at a bare minimum it has to cover its costs. A large bank can charge lower rates to recoup its costs. Because of the smaller loan size and more transactions, the MFI has to charge higher minimum rates.

Data from the GigFlorida μBank|MicroBank and/or μBanking|MicroBanking™ Bulletin reports that 63 of the world’s top GigFlorida μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ had an average rate of return, after adjusting for inflation and after taking out subsidies programs, of about 2.5% of total assets. This leads one to the hope that μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ can be sufficiently attractive for investors, as well as the mainstream in the retail banking sector.

### Typical μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and/or μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Products 
(KINDA) look like this (the numbers are only hypothetical):

### μLend | MicroLend:
---
Peer to peer lending, such as kiva

### μLoan | MicroLoan:
---

#### The Income Generating Loan (IGL): 
---
...is used for a variety of activities that generate income for their families. Clients submit a loan application and based on approval receive the loan after one week. Loans are paid in 50 equal, weekly installments. After completion of a loan cycle, the client can submit a loan application for a future loan. The approach with smaller short-term loans is to avoid long-term economic problems with bigger loans.

| μLoan | MicroLoan Product | Purpose | Terms | Interest rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| μLoan | MicroLoan: Income Generation Loan (IGL) | Income generation, asset development | 50 weeks loan paid weekly | 12.5% (flat) 24% (effective) |

#### The Mid Term Loan (MTL): 
---
...is available to clients after 25 weeks of repaying their IGL loan. A client is eligible for an MTL if the client has not taken the maximum amount of the IGL. The residual amount can be taken as an MTL. The terms and conditions of the MTL are otherwise the same as IGL.

| μLoan | MicroLoan Product | Purpose | Terms | Interest rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| μLoan | MicroLoan: Mid-Term Loan (MTL) | Same as IGL, available at the middle (week 25) of IGL | 50 weeks loan paid weekly | 12.5% (flat) 24% (effective) |

#### The Emergency Loan (EL):
---
...is available to all clients for a fiscal year. The loan is interest-free and the amount and repayment terms are agreed upon by the MFI and the client on a case by case basis. The amount is small compared to the income-generating products and is only given in times of dire need to meet expenses such as funerals, hospital admissions, prenatal care, and other crises.

| μLoan | MicroLoan Product | Purpose | Terms | Interest rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| μLoan | MicroLoan: Emergency Loan (EL) | All emergencies such as health, funerals, hospitalization | 20 weeks loan | 0% Interest-free |

#### The Individual Loan (IL): 
---
...is designed for clients and non-clients that have specific needs beyond the group lending model. Loans are given to an individual outside of the group lending process. Amounts are typically higher than that of the income-generating loan and repayments are less frequent. Applicants must complete a strict business appraisal process and have both collateral and a guarantor.

| μLoan | MicroLoan Product | Purpose | Terms | Interest rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| μLoan | MicroLoan: Individual Loan (IL) | Income generation, asset development | 1-2 years loan repaid monthly | 11% (flat) 23% (effective) |
---

μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and/or μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is not a panacea from all troubles, this also means that not any financially disadvantaged person can obtain a loan. In particular, representatives of the very financially disadvantaged population, lacking stable income, living through chance earnings, and particularly having debts (with community facilities, relatives, friends, etc…) cannot be clients of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and/or μFinance™|MicroFinance™, since in the case of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and/or μFinance™|MicroFinance™ non-repayment they will have more debts, becoming financially even more disadvantaged. For such people, special programs of social assistance are needed, which can support the main needs of people living in the financially more disadvantaged dwellings, lacking garments and food. There are some restrictions regarding what the money is used for. 

Usually, μCredits (Micro Credits) can not be used for the purposes like:
- Payments of Other Loans or Other Debts; ...cannot be used for Debt Consolidation
- Forming Turnover Capital of Trade and Intermediary Business;
- Organization, Production of,  or purchasing products for: 
- Any Tobacco and/or Medical Marijuana, for the population;
- Any Alcoholic and/or Liquor Products, for the population; 
- Any Gambling or Betting, for the population;
- Any Entertainment Services, for the population;
- Establishing trading points;
- Purchase of Any Property and/or Properties, that are not used for business.

In the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and/or μFinance™|MicroFinance™ sector, there are other services, many currently in development, as well. The financially disadvantaged need, like all of us, a secure place to save their money and access to insurance for their homes, businesses, and health. μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and/or μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions are now innovating new products to help meet these needs, empowering our reachable financially disadvantaged sector to improve their own lives. 

Products common used in the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and/or μFinance™|MicroFinance™ sector today are:

### Development in the GigFlorida μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and/or μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Sector
---

#### μSavings | MicroSavings
---
A possibility to save money without no-minimum balance. Allows people to retain money for future use or, unexpected costs. In SHGs, the members save small amounts of money, as little as a few rupees a month in a group fund. Members may borrow from the group fund for a variety of purposes ranging from household emergencies to school fees. As SHGs prove capable of managing their funds well, they may borrow from a local bank to invest in small business or farm activities. Banks typically lend up to four rupees for every rupee in the group fund;

A service for transferring money, mainly International Money overseas to family or friends. 

Money transfers without opening current accounts are performed by many commercial banks through international money transfer systems such as Western Union, Money Gram, and Anelik. On the surface, they may seem like small money transfers, but when one considers that such transactions take place millions of times around the world each week, the numbers start to become impressive. According to the World Bank, the annual global market for remittances – money transferred home from migrant workers – is around 167 billion US dollars. The estimated total is closer to 230 billion dollars if one counts unregulated transactions. Remittances are also an important source of income for many developing countries including India, China, and Mexico, all of which receive over 20 billion dollars each year in remittances from abroad.

### Using IT and EDGE Technology to reach scale
---
A key factor to being more successful in scaling in the Micro(μ)Finance industry efficiently is to use "The Power of IT Technologies" which already thousands of MFIs recognized. 
`` Technology is essential to reach new people, controlling risks make the business sustainable and more effective due to the costs.``
With mobile phones, ATMs, and other innovations the possibilities are endless, Directions Unlimited provides financial services more efficiently to financially disadvantaged people. Once improved the technology more “unbankable” are reached. Despite the big potential, there are still not enough MFIs reaching scale.

Access to affordable telecommunications simply does not exist for millions in the developing world. For some, placing a phone call can require traveling over six miles from their homes. This can mean leaving work and losing out on desperately needed income. Cut off from easy access to communications, these communities are at both an enormous economic and social disadvantage.

### Point of Sale Terminal
---
“Point Of Sale” (POS) terminals can be computers, bank card readers, or even mobile phones. Already many MFIS are using those tools to conduct business with their clients. POS terminals enable money transfers, bank transactions from balance inquiries, bill and loan payments, cash withdrawals, and deposits.

Using POS terminals Is much cheaper than building brick and mortar branches everywhere to reach the huge demand. Although they need staff to operate the terminal, it´s cheaper than staffing a bank office. Common technology is already something we can use today, it does not have to be innovated. The mobile phone is the most used tool today, people that don´t even have a telephone line now can be reached. That’s why most applications for Micro(μ)Finance also are innovated to work together with mobile phones. Solar energy systems are developed to charge the mobile phones in the villages where they even lack a traditional power grid.

ACCION International is using a system called “PortaCredit” and the “Mifa” system innovated by Grameen aiming to make heavy business transactions to clients cost less and be more efficient.

While the client always, in the end, has to pay for all costs, μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ needs to bring costs down even though it is enabling and empowering with personal contact with the clients. Their time has to be used effectively to improve the process. MFIs want to provide their financial services to clients with the same quality of products and services that clients receive from other service providers.

It is also about helping empower individuals, to understand how to use the power of technology, and how they can benefit from it.

### Weaknesses and Strengths
---
#### Weakness
---
There´s not much research done on the actual effectiveness of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ as a tool for economic growth. Some argue that there´s too much focus on μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ which will motivate less spending in other helping assistances as public health, welfare, and education.

Some are doubting μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ has that impact on poverty as the practitioners would submit. Others describe MicroCrediting as a privatization of public safety-net programs, as in the EBT Network. There are also some μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions charging largely excessive interest rates, uncool.

Questions against the Grameen Bank were raised in a Wall Street Journal article. It was regarding the repayment rate, collection methods, and questionable accounting practices.

Studies of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ programs have found that women often act as collection agents for their husbands and sons, such that the men spend the money themselves while women are saddled with the credit risk. Some borrowers have become dependent on loans for household expenditures rather than capital investments.

The key debate about μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is whether it should focus on improved welfare or financial sustainability. The two different approaches are usually named as “poverty lending” or “the welfarist approach” and “the institutionalist approach” or “financial system approach”. The welfarist approach could be for example supplying the customer with education and health whilst the institutionalists focus only on the financial service. 

The reason for that is only with a total focus on financial sustainability the huge demand can be met. MFIs with the welfarist approach are for example the Grameen Bank and Women´s World Banking. Examples of institutionalists are ACCION International and BRI Unit Desa.

#### Strength
---
The biggest strength is bringing financial services to financially disadvantaged people and making it financially sustainable by the economies of scale effect. In India, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) finances more than 500 banks that lend funds to Self Help Groups (SHG). SHGs comprise twenty or fewer members, of whom the majority are women from the most financially disadvantaged areas, castes, and tribes. Nearly 1.4 million SHGs comprising approximately 20 million women now borrow from banks, which makes the Indian SHG-Bank Linkage model the largest μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ program in the world. Similar programs are evolving in Africa and Southeast Asia with the assistance of organizations like Opportunity International, Catholic Relief Services, CARE, APMAS, and Oxfam. Also helps in the development of an economy by giving everyday people the chance to establish a sustainable means of income. Eventual increases in disposable income will lead to economic development and growth.

### Operating Methodology (COO), Working for μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Institutions

The Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, Everyday shares their Nobel Prize Winning Owner/CEO Secrets of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ has developed a joint liability model that its MFIs are, using acuarial services and Big Data, the output is suited for all your local past recorded historical data, present current data being the most important, and all future possible conditions.

In the feild, When choosing a village the MFI conducts a comprehensive survey to brief the potential for operations and the local conditions in a village. The MFI is evaluating some key factors like village population, degree of poverty, road accessibility, political stability, and safety. When a village has been selected, the MFI introduces its mission, methodology, and all the services they are offering, 
- however, it is actually what they understand, and also will accept, as they are normally scared, but willing to receieve help, therefore psychologically exhasted and truly overwhelmed.

After the informational presentation interested women are gathered in group formations. They have to be in the age between 18 and 59. The women put themselves together in groups of five to serve as guarantors for each other. Earlier experience has shown that a group of five persons is small enough to create group pressure between the members, enforcing them to be loyal to each other. In case one of the group members is not able to repay the loan the group is big enough to help with the payments. The company does not influence the selection of group members nor the decision regarding the income generation activity nor the loan amount they intend to take. Group members must live close to each other and cannot be related to each other.

If a borrower defaults on her loan, the entire group typically is penalized and sometimes barred altogether from taking further loans. This peer pressure encourages borrowers to be very selective about their peer group members and to repay loans in full and on time.

Then the group training begins, usually as a five-day program. The purpose is to educate the members in the procedures of the financial products, delivery methods, calculation of interest rates, business development skills, and how to sign their names. The members are also taught in quality management, to identify an income generation activity, how to set prices and how to market. The field staff also helps build a culture of credit discipline and collective responsibility. 

The field staff makes sure the members qualify for the program and collect data for future analysis. Within the village, a center is created to collect the groups. The center is responsible for the payments of all groups, enabling a dual liability system. When the village center is created the financial transactions can begin.

The groups meet weekly in the village center where they can discuss new loan applications, loan utilization, and community issues. The field staff of the MFIs conducts the meetings with rigid discipline to sustain the credit discipline of the group. All financial transactions are conducted during the meetings.

μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is a relatively new segment of the market economy that is why institutions created in this segment have short experience in their activities, and their personnel is not sufficiently experienced and qualified. Taking this into consideration, staff of these institutes is recommended to follow the internationally recognized principles of μCredit|MicroCredit and μFinance|MicroFinance:
- A thorough examination of potential clients of the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Institution;
- Thorough estimation of business viability and also factors which can positively or negatively affect the results of work in specific conditions;
- Thorough registration of documents and contracts related to loan issuance and μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ services providing
- Keep in touch with the client in combination with monitoring the terms of paying credit, interests payments and to find out potential and real problems;
- The setting of interest rates for μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ services compatible with current market rates;
- Quick reaction to any problems which can complicate the perspectives of getting of issued credit paid back.

# μCredit™|MicroCredit™: The definition of μFinance™|MicroFinance™
---
### Money growth 
---
“μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™, is banking the unbankable, bringing credit, savings, and all other financial services within the reach of millions of people who are too financially disadvantaged to be served by regular banks, in most cases because they are unable to offer sufficient collateral. In general, banks are for people with money, not for people without.” (Gert van Maanen, Microcredit: Sound Business or Development Instrument, Oikocredit, 2004)

“μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is based on the premise that the financially disadvantaged have skills that remain unutilized or underutilized. It is not the lack of skills that makes financially disadvantaged people financially disadvantaged….charity is not the answer to poverty. It only helps poverty to continue. It creates dependency and takes away the individual’s initiative to break through the wall of poverty. Unleashing of energy and creativity in each human being is the answer to poverty.” (Muhammad Yunus, Expanding MicroCredit Outreach to Reach the Millennium Development Goals, International Seminar on Attacking Poverty with MicroCredit, Dhaka, Bangladesh, January 2003)

μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ belongs to the group of financial service innovations under the term of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™, other services according to μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ are μSave™|MicroSave™ | μSaving™|MicroSaving™, Money Transfer Vehicles, and μInsurance™|MicroInsurance™. μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is an innovation for developing countries. 

μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is a service for: 
- Financially disadvantaged Individuals, that are unemployed. 
- Entrepreneurs, or farmers who are not bankable. 
The reason why they are not bankable is the lack of collateral, steady employment, income, and verifiable credit history, because of these reasons they can't even meet the minimal qualifications for ordinary credit. 

By helping people with μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ it gives them more available choices and opportunities with reduced risk. It has successfully enabled financially disadvantaged people to start their own business generating or sustaining an income and often begin to build up wealth and exit poverty. The amount of money that´is loaned out seldom exceeds USD $1000.00 ($25-$50-$75-$100-$125-$150-$175-$200-$500-$750-$999-)

μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ fits best to those with entrepreneurial capability and possibility. This translates to those financially disadvantaged who work in growing economies, and who can undertake activities that generate weekly stable incomes. For those who don't qualify because they are extremely financially disadvantaged like destitute and homeless almost every μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institution has special safety programs that offer basic subsistence and later endeavors to graduate these members in their μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ program making ordinary μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ available.

μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ plays an important role in fighting the multi-dimensional aspects of poverty. 
μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ increases household income, which leads to attendant benefits such as increased food security, the building of assets, and an increased likelihood of educating oneself and/or children. 
μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is also a means for self-empowerment. It enables the financially disadvantaged to make changes when they increase income, become business owners and reduce their vulnerability to external shocks like illness, weather, and more.

μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ has widely been directed by the non-profit sector while commercial lenders require more conventional forms of collateral before making loans to μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions. But now it´s successfully growing bigger and getting more credibility in the traditional finance world. Due to that, the traditional banking industry has begun to realize that these borrowers fit more correctly in a category called pre-bankable. The industry has realized that those who lack access to traditional formal financial institutions require and desire a variety of financial products. Nowadays the mainstream finance industry is counting the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ projects as a source of growth. Before almost everyone were neglecting the success of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ at the beginning of the 1970s when pilot projects such as ACCION were released until the United Nations declared 2005 the International Year of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™.

Most of the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions and agencies all over the world focuses on women in developing countries. Observations and experience show that women are a small credit risk, repaying their loans and tend more often to benefit the whole family. In another aspect, it´s also seen as a method giving the women more status in a socioeconomic way and changing the current conservative relationship between gender and class when women can provide income to the household. Women are in most cases responsible for children, and in financially disadvantaged conditions, it results in physical and social underdevelopment of their children. 1.2 billion people are living on less than a dollar a day. There are many reasons why women have become the primary target of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ services. A recent World Bank report confirms that societies that discriminate based on gender pay the cost of greater poverty, slower economic growth, weaker governance, and a lower living standard for all people. At a macro level, it is because 70 percent of the worlds most financially disadvantaged are women. Women have a higher unemployment rate than men in virtually every country and make up the majority of the informal sector of most economies. They constitute the bulk of those who need μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ services.

Giving women access to μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ loans, therefore, generates a multiplier effect that increases the impact of a μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institution’s activities, benefiting multiple generations.

### History of: μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™
---
The history of μCrediting™|MicroCrediting™ and μFinancing™|MicroFinancing™ can be traced back as long as the middle of the 1800s when the theorist Lysander Spooner was writing over the benefits from small credits to entrepreneurs and farmers as a way of getting people out of poverty. But it was at the end of World War II with the Marshall plan the concept had a big impact.

The today use of the expression μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ has its roots in the 1970s when organizations, such as Grameen Bank of Bangladesh with the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ pioneer Mohammad Yunus, were starting and shaping the modern industry of μCrediting™|MicroCrediting™ and μFinancing™|MicroFinancing™. Another pioneer in this sector is Akhtar Hameed Khan. At that time a new wave of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ initiatives introduced many innovations into the sector. Many pioneering enterprises began experimenting with loaning to underserved people. The main reason why μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is dated to the 1970s is that the programs could show that people can be relied on to repay their loans and that it´s possible to provide financial services to financially disadvantaged people through market-based enterprises without subsidies. Shorebank was the first μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ and community development bank founded in 1974 in Chicago.

An economical historian at Yale named Timothy Guinnane has been doing some research on Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen´s village bank movement in Germany which started in 1864 and by the year 1901, the bank had reached 2million rural farmers. Timothy Guinnane means that already then it was proved that μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ could pass the two tests concerning the common people’s payback-moral and the possibility to provide financial service to financially disadvantaged people.

Another organization, The Caisse Populaire movement grounded by Alphone and Dorimène Desjardins in Quebec, was also concerned about poverty and passed those two tests. Between 1900 to 1906 when they founded the first Caisse, they passed a law governing them in the Quebec assembly, they risked their private assets and must have been very sure about the idea about μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™.

Today the World Bank estimates that more than 16 million people are served by some 7000 μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions all over the world. CGAP experts mean that about 500 million families benefit from these small loans making new business possible. In a gathering at a μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Summit in Washington DC, the goal was reaching 100 million of the world´s most financially disadvantaged people by credits from the world leaders and major financial institutions.

The year 2005 was proclaimed as the International Year of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ by The Economic and Social Council of the United Nations in a call for the financial and building sector to “fuel” the strong entrepreneurial spirit of the financially disadvantaged people around the world.

The International Year of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ consists of five goals:
- Assess and promote the contribution of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ to the MFIs
- Making μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ more visible for public awareness and understanding is a very important part of the development situation
- The promotion should be inclusive of the financial sector
- Make a supporting system for sustainable access to financial services
- Support strategic partnerships by encouraging new partnerships and innovation to build and expand the outreach and success of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ for all

The economics professor Mohammad Yunus and the founder of Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel Prize 2006 for his efforts. The press release from nobelprize.org states:

“The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2006, divided into two equal parts, to Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank for their efforts to create economic and social development from below. Lasting peace can not be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty. μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is one such means. Development from below also serves to advance democracy and human rights. Muhammad Yunus has shown himself to be a leader who has managed to translate visions into practical action for the benefit of millions of people, not only in Bangladesh but also in many other countries. Loans to financially disadvantaged people without any financial security had appeared to be an impossible idea. From modest beginnings three decades ago, Yunus has, first and foremost through Grameen Bank, developed μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ into an ever more important instrument in the struggle against poverty. Grameen Bank has been a source of ideas and models for the many institutions in the field of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ that have sprung up around the world.

Every single individual on earth has both the potential and the right to live a decent life. Across cultures and civilizations, Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that even the most financially disadvantaged of all the financially disadvantaged can work to bring about their development.

μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ has proved to be an important liberating force in societies where women, in particular, have to struggle against repressive social and economic conditions. Economic growth and political democracy can not achieve their full potential unless the female half of humanity participates on an equal footing with the male.

Yunus’s long-term vision is to eliminate poverty in the world. That vision can not be realized through μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ alone. But Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that, in the continuing efforts to achieve it, μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ must play a major part.”

### The Fundamentals of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™
---
The managers at the MFIs are careful to ensure the borrower's success and inform about the risks involved, which makes, in general, the borrower performs better. This leads often to earned dignity and lasting self-confidence associated with responsible loan repayment.

To have a sustainable growing economy it takes high entrepreneurship and energy to develop the world and fight poverty. Independent and responsible entrepreneurs are valuable resources that can take advantage of the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ industry. They will not take big risks and must be supported by predictable financing.

Normal bank operations suit better to large transactions which are more profitable, the traditional operating philosophy is to invest in facilities and they have costly operating structures. The traditional financing industry must either change itself or stay out of the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ business. A new generation of banking institutions is growing in a market of very small transactions and less affluent clients. With lowered transactions costs through institutional specialization and innovation in delivery systems, they will be able to operate profitably in this market serving the financially disadvantaged with financial services.

The financially disadvantaged entrepreneurs are the future representing the population who will become successful in the nearby future. They have the same will and skills as the toughest business operators. They are economical, don’t take big risks, and repay debts as scheduled to maintain the possibility of borrowing money in the future.

This requires a new groundbreaking banking system with scale economics. Modifying the standard system will simply not be enough, the financially disadvantaged people will continue to stay outside their country´s economy. Building up μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions serving financially disadvantaged people is a relatively cost-effective use of subsidies for economic development compared to other supporting strategies for welfare.

### Economies of scale
---
MFIs need both capital and internal operating capacity to achieve scale. Since 1970 μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ has been proven to be one of the most effective and sustainable tools in poverty-fighting. But still are 80 percent of the working financially disadvantaged, more than 400 million families, are without the reach of financial services. To be able to serve everyone the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ industry must be even more efficient and grow to scale. At today's growth rates it will take decades for the rest 80 percent to be served.

### Access to μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Regional Breakdown
---
The most critical problem today is finding money to lend out to the financially disadvantaged. Existing μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ programs are coming to a virtual halt in their expansion program and finding it difficult to continue their present program because of a lack of funds.

### μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ failing to close the gap

Many μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions are self-sustaining but most of the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions still rely on and must get rid of their dependency on donor money to reach scale. Large amounts of money are needed to expand their operational capacity to reach economies of scale rapidly. 

Without sufficient internal operating capacity growth suddenly stops once a program reaches several thousand clients. They must provide their financial products to a much bigger amount of clients. The only possibility to access large amounts of money is in the traditional financial market. The problem for most MFIs to attract this money is the lack of track record and well-formed business plans.

The key solution to the right internal operating capacity includes improving for example the information technology, internal controls, new product development, and human resources. When MFIs rely too much on donor money it´s very hard to do the necessary investments in the areas that are sustainable and with the possibility to expand. That´s why most MFIs are small and stay small which this figure visualizes. About 73% of all μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions serve less than 2500 clients.

## Most MFIs are very small

#### μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Institutions (MFIs)
---
Poverty is the main cause of concern in improving the economic status of developing countries. A μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institution is an organization that offers financial services to low-income populations. Almost all give loans to their members, and many offer insurance, deposit, and other services.

A great scale of organizations is regarded as μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutes. They are those that offer credits and other financial services to the representatives of financially disadvantaged strata of the population (except for extremely financially disadvantaged strata).

- μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is increasingly being considered as one of the most effective tools of reducing poverty by enabling 
- μCredit™|MicroCredit™ to the Financially Disadvantaged. 
- μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ has a significant role in bridging the gap between formal financial institutions and the rural financially disadvantaged.
- μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Institutions (MFIs) accesses financial resources from the Banks and other mainstream Financial Institutions and provide financially and support services to the financially disadvantaged.

MFIs are the pivotal overseas organizations in each country that make individual μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ loans directly to: 
- villagers, 
- microentrepreneurs, 
- impoverished women, and 
- financially disadvantaged families. 

An overseas MFI is like a small bank with the same challenges and capital needs confronting any expanding small venture but with the added responsibility of serving economically marginalized populations. Many MFIs are creditworthy and well-run with proven records of success, many are operationally self-sufficient.

Various types of institutions offer μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™: 
- credit unions, 
- commercial banks, 
- NGOs (Non-governmental Organizations), 
- cooperatives, and 
- sectors of government banks. 

The emergence of “for-profit” MFIs is growing. In India, these ‘for-profit’ MFIs are referred to as Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC). NGOs mainly work in remote rural areas thereby providing financial services to people with no access to banking services.

The term “transformation,” or commercialization, of a μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institution (MFI), refers to a change in legal status from an unregulated nonprofit or non-governmental organization (NGO) into a regulated, for-profit institution. Regulated, transformed organizations differ from nonprofits in that they are held to performance and capital adequacy standards and are supervised by a financial authority, typically the central bank of the country where they are registered. A transformed MFI also attracts equity investors. The equity investors want to ensure that the values of their investments are maintained or enhanced and elect Board members who share a common vision for the new for-profit institution. Among transformed MFIs, varying classifications of regulated institutions exist, the strictest being banks — rural banks and thrift banks — followed by non-bank financial institutions. Different countries have varied names for these regulated MFIs.

The μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ sector consistently focuses on understanding the needs of the financially disadvantaged and on devising better ways of delivering services in line with their requirements, developing the most efficient and effective mechanisms to deliver finance to the financially disadvantaged. Continuous efforts towards automation of operations are steadily improving inefficiency. The automated systems have also helped accelerate the growth rate of the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ sector.

### The goal for MFIs should be:
---
To improve the quality of life of the financially disadvantaged by providing access to financial and support services;

To be a viable financial institution developing sustainable communities;
To mobilize resources to provide both, financial and support services to the financially disadvantaged, particularly women, for viable productive income generation enterprises enabling them to reduce their poverty;
Learn and evaluate what helps people to move out of poverty faster;
To create opportunities for self-employment for the underprivileged;
To train rural financially disadvantaged in simple skills and enable them to utilize the available resources and contribute to employment and income generation in rural areas.

### Funding / Financial Institutions:
---
The mission of the funding institutions is to help MFIs operate more efficiently and be more effective. They provide each partner with financial products and services that are tailored to meet their needs.

A goal is to ensure the partners are moving their clients out of poverty and to foster good practices for measuring the progress of the individuals' movement across poverty lines. MFIs must show results, yet many do not have the tools to evaluate how well they are fulfilling their mission of reducing poverty, reaching people excluded from financial services, empowering women, or promoting community solidarity. That´s why they should also equip Micro(μ)Finance institutions with tools to measure their clients’ progress out of poverty. Built on the learnings of previous efforts in the Micro(μ)Finance industry they can develop the operational methods in reaching the clients. Innovative financing solutions and strategies to expand the capacity and efficiency of the MFIs provide a direct impact on the lives of the financially disadvantaged and advance the Micro(μ)Finance industry as it moves toward even higher standards in terms of anti-poverty impact and financial performance.

### μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ products:
---
Offering financial services to the homeless, vagrant, the financially disadvantaged, and down-trotted, the financially uneducated and fiscally unwise, people in financial development, for the successes of their households, businesses, neighborhoods... This is an expensive business...

The cost is one of the biggest reasons why traditional banks do not make small loans, the resources required for a 50$ loan are the same as for a 1000$ loan.

GigFlorida μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™, also has the personnel and administration costs. Field staff managers must perform household and business surveys before entering a household or business, conduct interviews with potential borrowers, in a lot of individual cases, we have to educate the borrowers in credit discipline, travel to the households and businesses every week to collect interest, and distribute loans and control that the loans are being used for the given purpose.

The μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ loan cycles are usually shorter than traditional commercial loans with terms from typically six months to a year with payments plus interest, paid weekly. Shorter loan cycles and weekly payments help the borrowers stay current and not become surprised by large payments. The transaction-intense nature of weekly payment collections, often in rural areas, is more expensive than running a bank branch that provides large loans to economically secure borrowers in a metropolitan area. As a result, GigFlorida μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ must charge interest rates that might sound high.

To be able to lend out money, the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions must in addition borrow from the traditional finance sector with a commercial perspective. There´s always about 1-2% loss on loans due to people not paying back. To be able to expand business the GigFlorida μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ must also make some profit, at least 1-2%. All in all, it´s easier to understand why GigFlorida μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ charges their customer interest rates which at first sight might appear high. With a growing market, better economics of scale and increasing efficiency the cost will reduce, and lower interest rates are able.

For a financial institution to scale and remain sustainable, at a bare minimum it has to cover its costs. A large bank can charge lower rates to recoup its costs. Because of the smaller loan size and more transactions, the MFI has to charge higher minimum rates.

Data from the GigFlorida μBank|MicroBank and/or μBanking|MicroBanking™ Bulletin reports that 63 of the world’s top GigFlorida μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ had an average rate of return, after adjusting for inflation and after taking out subsidies programs, of about 2.5% of total assets. This leads one to the hope that μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ can be sufficiently attractive for investors, as well as the mainstream in the retail banking sector.

### Typical μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and/or μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Products 
(KINDA) look like this (the numbers are only hypothetical):

### μLend | MicroLend:
---
Peer to peer lending, such as kiva

### μLoan | MicroLoan:
---

#### The Income Generating Loan (IGL): 
---
...is used for a variety of activities that generate income for their families. Clients submit a loan application and based on approval receive the loan after one week. Loans are paid in 50 equal, weekly installments. After completion of a loan cycle, the client can submit a loan application for a future loan. The approach with smaller short-term loans is to avoid long-term economic problems with bigger loans.

| μLoan | MicroLoan Product | Purpose | Terms | Interest rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| μLoan | MicroLoan: Income Generation Loan (IGL) | Income generation, asset development | 50 weeks loan paid weekly | 12.5% (flat) 24% (effective) |

#### The Mid Term Loan (MTL): 
---
...is available to clients after 25 weeks of repaying their IGL loan. A client is eligible for an MTL if the client has not taken the maximum amount of the IGL. The residual amount can be taken as an MTL. The terms and conditions of the MTL are otherwise the same as IGL.

| μLoan | MicroLoan Product | Purpose | Terms | Interest rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| μLoan | MicroLoan: Mid-Term Loan (MTL) | Same as IGL, available at the middle (week 25) of IGL | 50 weeks loan paid weekly | 12.5% (flat) 24% (effective) |

#### The Emergency Loan (EL):
---
...is available to all clients for a fiscal year. The loan is interest-free and the amount and repayment terms are agreed upon by the MFI and the client on a case by case basis. The amount is small compared to the income-generating products and is only given in times of dire need to meet expenses such as funerals, hospital admissions, prenatal care, and other crises.

| μLoan | MicroLoan Product | Purpose | Terms | Interest rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| μLoan | MicroLoan: Emergency Loan (EL) | All emergencies such as health, funerals, hospitalization | 20 weeks loan | 0% Interest-free |

#### The Individual Loan (IL): 
---
...is designed for clients and non-clients that have specific needs beyond the group lending model. Loans are given to an individual outside of the group lending process. Amounts are typically higher than that of the income-generating loan and repayments are less frequent. Applicants must complete a strict business appraisal process and have both collateral and a guarantor.

| μLoan | MicroLoan Product | Purpose | Terms | Interest rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| μLoan | MicroLoan: Individual Loan (IL) | Income generation, asset development | 1-2 years loan repaid monthly | 11% (flat) 23% (effective) |

μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and/or μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is not a panacea from all troubles, this also means that not any financially disadvantaged person can obtain a loan. In particular, representatives of the very financially disadvantaged population, lacking stable income, living through chance earnings, and particularly having debts (with community facilities, relatives, friends, etc…) cannot be clients of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and/or μFinance™|MicroFinance™, since in the case of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and/or μFinance™|MicroFinance™ non-repayment they will have more debts, becoming financially even more disadvantaged. For such people, special programs of social assistance are needed, which can support the main needs of people living in the financially more disadvantaged dwellings, lacking garments and food. There are some restrictions regarding what the money is used for. 

Usually, μCredits (Micro Credits) can not be used for the purposes like:
- Payments of Other Loans or Other Debts; ...cannot be used for Debt Consolidation
- Forming Turnover Capital of Trade and Intermediary Business;
- Organization, Production of,  or purchasing products for: 
- Any Tobacco and/or Medical Marijuana, for the population;
- Any Alcoholic and/or Liquor Products, for the population; 
- Any Gambling or Betting, for the population;
- Any Entertainment Services, for the population;
- Establishing trading points;
- Purchase of Any Property and/or Properties, that are not used for business.

In the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and/or μFinance™|MicroFinance™ sector, there are other services, many currently in development, as well. The financially disadvantaged need, like all of us, a secure place to save their money and access to insurance for their homes, businesses, and health. μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and/or μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions are now innovating new products to help meet these needs, empowering our reachable financially disadvantaged sector to improve their own lives. 

Products common used in the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and/or μFinance™|MicroFinance™ sector today are:

### Development in the GigFlorida μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and/or μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Sector
---

#### μSavings | MicroSavings
---
A possibility to save money without no-minimum balance. Allows people to retain money for future use or, unexpected costs. In SHGs, the members save small amounts of money, as little as a few rupees a month in a group fund. Members may borrow from the group fund for a variety of purposes ranging from household emergencies to school fees. As SHGs prove capable of managing their funds well, they may borrow from a local bank to invest in small business or farm activities. Banks typically lend up to four rupees for every rupee in the group fund;

#### μInsurance | MicroInsurance
---
Gives the entrepreneurs the chance to focus more on their core business which drastically reduces the risk affecting their property, health, or working possibilities. There are different types of insurance services like life insurance, property insurance, health insurance, and disability insurance. The spectrum of services in this sphere is constantly expanded, as schemes and terms of providing insurance services are determined by each company individually;

#### μLeasing | MicroLeasing

#### μTransfer | MicroTransfer
#### μCash | MicroCash
#### μNotary | MicroNotary
---
A service for transferring money, mainly International Money overseas to family or friends. 

Money transfers without opening current accounts are performed by many commercial banks through international money transfer systems such as Western Union, Money Gram, and Anelik. On the surface, they may seem like small money transfers, but when one considers that such transactions take place millions of times around the world each week, the numbers start to become impressive. According to the World Bank, the annual global market for remittances – money transferred home from migrant workers – is around 167 billion US dollars. The estimated total is closer to 230 billion dollars if one counts unregulated transactions. Remittances are also an important source of income for many developing countries including India, China, and Mexico, all of which receive over 20 billion dollars each year in remittances from abroad.

### Using IT and EDGE Technology to reach scale
---
A key factor to being more successful in scaling in the Micro(μ)Finance industry efficiently is to use "The Power of IT Technologies" which already thousands of MFIs recognized. 
`` Technology is essential to reach new people, controlling risks make the business sustainable and more effective due to the costs.``
With mobile phones, ATMs, and other innovations the possibilities are endless, Directions Unlimited provides financial services more efficiently to financially disadvantaged people. Once improved the technology more “unbankable” are reached. Despite the big potential, there are still not enough MFIs reaching scale.

Access to affordable telecommunications simply does not exist for millions in the developing world. For some, placing a phone call can require traveling over six miles from their homes. This can mean leaving work and losing out on desperately needed income. Cut off from easy access to communications, these communities are at both an enormous economic and social disadvantage.

### Point of Sale Terminal
---
“Point Of Sale” (POS) terminals can be computers, bank card readers, or even mobile phones. Already many MFIS are using those tools to conduct business with their clients. POS terminals enable money transfers, bank transactions from balance inquiries, bill and loan payments, cash withdrawals, and deposits.

Using POS terminals Is much cheaper than building brick and mortar branches everywhere to reach the huge demand. Although they need staff to operate the terminal, it´s cheaper than staffing a bank office. Common technology is already something we can use today, it does not have to be innovated. The mobile phone is the most used tool today, people that don´t even have a telephone line now can be reached. That’s why most applications for Micro(μ)Finance also are innovated to work together with mobile phones. Solar energy systems are developed to charge the mobile phones in the villages where they even lack a traditional power grid.

ACCION International is using a system called “PortaCredit” and the “Mifa” system innovated by Grameen aiming to make heavy business transactions to clients cost less and be more efficient.

While the client always, in the end, has to pay for all costs, μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ needs to bring costs down even though it is enabling and empowering with personal contact with the clients. Their time has to be used effectively to improve the process. MFIs want to provide their financial services to clients with the same quality of products and services that clients receive from other service providers.

Mind Exercise: When gathering all together your `μCredit™|MicroCredit™` and `μFinance™|MicroFinance™` knowledge, and separtately, gathering all together Your Past Expiriences, The Current Operating Configuration, Therefore you can see what is needed in the Future, Vast Technological Knowledge, creatively the two different branches, new areas, unthought innovations can arise, creating new business opportunities. It is also about helping empower individuals, to understand how to use the power of technology, and how they can benefit from it.

### Weaknesses and Strengths
---
#### Weakness
---
There´s not much research done on the actual effectiveness of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ as a tool for economic growth. Some argue that there´s too much focus on μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ which will motivate less spending in other helping assistances as public health, welfare, and education.

Some are doubting μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ has that impact on poverty as the practitioners would submit. Others describe MicroCrediting as a privatization of public safety-net programs, as in the EBT Network. There are also some μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ institutions charging largely excessive interest rates, uncool.

Questions against the Grameen Bank were raised in a Wall Street Journal article. It was regarding the repayment rate, collection methods, and questionable accounting practices.

Studies of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ programs have found that women often act as collection agents for their husbands and sons, such that the men spend the money themselves while women are saddled with the credit risk. Some borrowers have become dependent on loans for household expenditures rather than capital investments.

The key debate about μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is whether it should focus on improved welfare or financial sustainability. The two different approaches are usually named as “poverty lending” or “the welfarist approach” and “the institutionalist approach” or “financial system approach”. The welfarist approach could be for example supplying the customer with education and health whilst the institutionalists focus only on the financial service. 

The reason for that is only with a total focus on financial sustainability the huge demand can be met. MFIs with the welfarist approach are for example the Grameen Bank and Women´s World Banking. Examples of institutionalists are ACCION International and BRI Unit Desa.

#### Strength
---
The biggest strength is bringing financial services to financially disadvantaged people and making it financially sustainable by the economies of scale effect. In India, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) finances more than 500 banks that lend funds to Self Help Groups (SHG). SHGs comprise twenty or fewer members, of whom the majority are women from the most financially disadvantaged areas, castes, and tribes. Nearly 1.4 million SHGs comprising approximately 20 million women now borrow from banks, which makes the Indian SHG-Bank Linkage model the largest μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ program in the world. Similar programs are evolving in Africa and Southeast Asia with the assistance of organizations like Opportunity International, Catholic Relief Services, CARE, APMAS, and Oxfam. Also helps in the development of an economy by giving everyday people the chance to establish a sustainable means of income. Eventual increases in disposable income will lead to economic development and growth.

### Operating Methodology (COO), Working for μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Institutions

The Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, Everyday shares their Nobel Prize Winning Owner/CEO Secrets of μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ has developed a joint liability model that its MFIs are, using acuarial services and Big Data, the output is suited for all your local past recorded historical data, present current data being the most important, and all future possible conditions.

In the feild, When choosing a village the MFI conducts a comprehensive survey to brief the potential for operations and the local conditions in a village. The MFI is evaluating some key factors like village population, degree of poverty, road accessibility, political stability, and safety. When a village has been selected, the MFI introduces its mission, methodology, and all the services they are offering, 
- however, it is actually what they understand, and also will accept, as they are normally scared, but willing to receieve help, therefore psychologically exhasted and truly overwhelmed.

After the informational presentation interested women are gathered in group formations. They have to be in the age between 18 and 59. The women put themselves together in groups of five to serve as guarantors for each other. Earlier experience has shown that a group of five persons is small enough to create group pressure between the members, enforcing them to be loyal to each other. In case one of the group members is not able to repay the loan the group is big enough to help with the payments. The company does not influence the selection of group members nor the decision regarding the income generation activity nor the loan amount they intend to take. Group members must live close to each other and cannot be related to each other.

If a borrower defaults on her loan, the entire group typically is penalized and sometimes barred altogether from taking further loans. This peer pressure encourages borrowers to be very selective about their peer group members and to repay loans in full and on time.

Then the group training begins, usually as a five-day program. The purpose is to educate the members in the procedures of the financial products, delivery methods, calculation of interest rates, business development skills, and how to sign their names. The members are also taught in quality management, to identify an income generation activity, how to set prices and how to market. The field staff also helps build a culture of credit discipline and collective responsibility. 

The field staff makes sure the members qualify for the program and collect data for future analysis. Within the village, a center is created to collect the groups. The center is responsible for the payments of all groups, enabling a dual liability system. When the village center is created the financial transactions can begin.

The groups meet weekly in the village center where they can discuss new loan applications, loan utilization, and community issues. The field staff of the MFIs conducts the meetings with rigid discipline to sustain the credit discipline of the group. All financial transactions are conducted during the meetings.

μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ is a relatively new segment of the market economy that is why institutions created in this segment have short experience in their activities, and their personnel is not sufficiently experienced and qualified. Taking this into consideration, staff of these institutes is recommended to follow the internationally recognized principles of μCredit|MicroCredit and μFinance|MicroFinance:
- A thorough examination of potential clients of the μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ Institution;
- Thorough estimation of business viability and also factors which can positively or negatively affect the results of work in specific conditions;
- Thorough registration of documents and contracts related to loan issuance and μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ services providing
- Keep in touch with the client in combination with monitoring the terms of paying credit, interests payments and to find out potential and real problems;
- The setting of interest rates for μCredit™|MicroCredit™ and μFinance™|MicroFinance™ services compatible with current market rates;
- Quick reaction to any problems which can complicate the perspectives of getting of issued credit paid back.
