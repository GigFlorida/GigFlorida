# Journals and Magazines

---

Journals and magazines are important sources for up-to-date information in all disciplines. With an online periodical collection as large and diverse as the one the Libraries provide, it is often difficult to distinguish among the levels of scholarship represented. It's important to distinguish among the types of journals and magazines that you should use to fulfill the requirements of class assignments.
In this guide we have divided the criteria for periodical literature into four categories:

- Scholarly Music News & Analysis, and/or Commentary

- Professional / Trade Music News & Analysis, and/or Commentary

- Popular & General Interest / Sensational Music News & Analysis, and/or Commentary

---

SOME DEFINITIONS:
Webster's Third International Dictionary defines

- Scholarly: concerned with academic study, especially research, exhibiting the methods and attitudes of a scholar, and having the manner and appearance of a scholar.

- Professional: engaged in one of the learned professions or in an occupation requiring a high level of training and proficiency; reflecting the results of education, training, and experience.

- Trade: group of persons engaged in a particular occupation, business; group of firms or corporations engaged in a line of work.

- Substantive: having a solid base, being substantial.

- Popular: fit for, or reflecting the taste and intelligence of, the people at large.

- Sensational: arousing or intending to arouse strong curiosity, interest or reaction.

Keeping these definitions in mind, and realizing that none of the lines drawn among types of journals can ever be totally clear-cut, please consult the tabs across the top of the page to learn more about each type of journal or magazine.

### Scholarly - Notebooks, Journals

---

- Scholarly, Academic, Peer-Reviewed, Juried, and/or Refereed — These are all synonyms for the same type of journal, one that presents and preserves a record of scholarship for an academic or research-oriented audience. The language of scholarly journals is that of the discipline covered. It assumes some academic background on the part of the reader.

- Many academic journals, though by no means all, are published by scholarly societies or discipline-specific professional organizations. As part of the publication process, scholarly articles are reviewed by committees of other notable scholars. Such reviewers are considered to be the writer's peers; hence, the term peer-reviewed journal. Usually, a committee or jury of scholars does the reviewing; hence, the terms juried journal or refereed journal.

- Peer-reviewed articles most often have an abstract or descriptive summary of the article printed before the main text starts. The affiliations of the authors are provided, usually at the bottom of the first page or at the end of the article — universities, research institutes, think tanks, and the like.

- Refereed articles build upon the scholarship of the past to advance knowledge in a field; thus, they will always cite their sources in the form of footnotes or bibliographies to which the reader can refer in her own pursuit of the topic. 

Moreover, the ethics of scholarship require that a writer clearly identify those works of others writers upon which his own work is based.

#### EXAMPLES OF SCHOLARLY JOURNALS:
- American Economic Review
- Reading Research Quarterly
- JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association
- Journal of Marriage and the Family (published by the National Council on Family Relations)
- Modern Fiction Studies
- Sex Roles: A Journal of Research

## Professional & Trade Magazines & Journals

---

### Professional Magazines or Journals

---

- A professional magazine or journal is one produced by a professional organization and tailored to the interests of its members. 

- The peer-review process is not employed in the process of presenting content to readers. 

- The editorial staff is responsible for the accuracy and verifiability of content as it works with contributors.

- Professional magazines present news and analysis, editorial comments, and book reviews of interest to the association's members and often take the form of newsletters.

In some fields, they also present extensive professional development articles for the improvement of skills. The level of writing and execution can sometimes be quite high, approaching the scholarly. This sort of professional journal can be very useful to both practitioners of a professional and to college students who are engaged in professional preparation.

#### EXAMPLES OF PROFESSIONAL MAGAZINES
- Education Week
- Teaching Pre-K-8
- Monitor on Psychology
- NAEA News
- NCTM Bulletin

### Trade or Industry Magazines

---

- A trade journal or trade magazine is a periodical published with the intention of marketing ideas, products, or services to a specific industry or type of trade/business.

- The collective term for this area of publishing is the trade press. The peer-review process is not employed in the process of presenting content to readers. The editorial staff is responsible for the accuracy and verifiability of content as it works with contributors.

- Trade and industry journals typically contain advertising content focused on the industry in question with little if any general-audience advertising. They also generally contain industry-specific job notices, a highly pertinent aspect to many readers.

- Many trade publications can also be considered news magazines with a very specific topical focus. Some trade journals operate under controlled circulation, meaning the publisher decides who may receive complimentary subscriptions based on each individual's qualification as a member of the trade. This allows a high level of certainty that advertisements will be received by the advertiser's target audience.

In some instances, the boundary between trade publication and peer-reviewed journal has blurred. One such example is BioTechniques, which contains peer-reviewed technical reports and technology reviews while containing heavy advertising content, a significant proportion of the articles being authored by or in collaboration with vendors who advertise in the same issue.

#### EXAMPLES OF TRADE MAGAZINES
- Billboard
- Advertising Age
- Beverage World
- Automotive News
- Progressive Grocer

## News & Analysis Publications

---

### SUBSTANTIVE NEWS & ANALYSIS OR GENERAL INTEREST MAGAZINES

---

- These periodicals may be quite attractive in appearance, and many are in newspaper format. Articles are often heavily illustrated, generally with photographs.

- News and analysis and general interest periodicals sometimes cite sources as scholarly journals do, though more often do not. Articles may be written by a member of the editorial staff, a scholar, or a free-lance writer. 

- The peer-review process is not employed in the process of presenting content to readers.

- The editorial staff is responsible for the accuracy and verifiability of content as it works with contributors.

- The language-level of these publications is generally aimed at any educated audience. 

- There is no specialty assumed in the reader, only the interest to pursue the information contained and a medium education level.

- They are generally published by commercial enterprises or individuals, although some emanate from specific professional, non-profit organizations.

The main purpose of periodicals in this category is to provide information and news and analysis of current events, in a general manner, to a broad audience of concerned citizens.

## Popular & Sensational Magazines

### POPULAR PERIODICALS

---

- Popular periodicals come in many formats, although often somewhat slick and attractive in appearance, with lots of graphics (photographs, drawings, etc.).

- These publications rarely, if ever, cite sources. Information published in such journals is often second- or third-hand and the original source is sometimes obscure.

- Articles are usually very short, written in simple language and are designed to meet a minimal education level. 

- There is generally little depth to the content of these articles.

### SENSATIONAL PERIODICALS

---

- Sensational periodicals are a particular variety of popular magazine. They come in a variety of styles, but often use a newspaper format. 

- Their language is elementary and occasionally inflammatory or sensational. They assume a certain gullibility in their audience.

- The main purpose of sensational magazines seems to be to arouse curiosity, to cater to popular superstitions, and to sell advertising. 

- They often do so with flashy headlines designed to Shock and Astonish (e.g. Half-man / Half-woman Makes Self Pregnant).

- Globe
- National Examiner
- National Inquirer
- Star Weekly
- World News
